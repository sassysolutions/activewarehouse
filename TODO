TODO list:

* Modify the fact generator so that the migration has a map for foreign keay and a map for fact attributes. The foreign keys can then automatically be indexed as that is pretty much standard behavior.
* Make the belongs_to connection between facts and dimensions automatic.
* Change the terminology from "hierarchical dimension" to "recursive dimension" or something else less confusing.
